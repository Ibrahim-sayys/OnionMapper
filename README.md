![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)

## üåü Overview
**OnionMapper** is a cutting-edge project aimed at classifying and analyzing `.onion` websites on the Dark Web. Using advanced web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning techniques, the project extracts meaningful insights, identifies patterns, and categorizes websites based on their content and intent.

> This project is designed for researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts exploring the hidden corners of the web responsibly.

## üöÄ Features
- üîç **Onion Site Scraping**: Access `.onion` websites through the Tor network and gather HTML content.
- ‚ú® **Keyword Extraction**: Extract meaningful keywords from `.onion` websites to identify their primary focus.
- ü§ñ **Classification**: Use machine learning models to classify content into categories (e.g., marketplaces, forums, blogs).
- üìä **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations and reports for better understanding.
- üåê **Tor Integration**: Automatically route requests through the Tor network for secure and anonymous data collection.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
